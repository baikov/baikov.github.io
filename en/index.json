This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well. Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

Dictionary keys are arbitrary, immutable (hashable) values. The values in dictionary items can be of any data type. Dictionaries are ordered. Dictionaries and dictionary view objects (dict.keys(), dict.values(), dict.items()) are now reversible. Dictionaries can be created by several means: # Use a comma-separated list of key: value pairs within braces dict1 = {'Moscow': 1023, 'SPB': 2048} # Use a dict comprehension dict2 = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)} # Use the type constructor dict3 = dict([('foo', 100), ('bar', 200)]) dict4 = dict(foo=100, bar=200) In other programming languages, a dictionary-like data type might be called an associative array, hash, or hash table.
